Pimp my Debian
==============

Awesome Debian annoyment reliever.
Retries a command until all the perl dependencies are met.

Usage:

  ./pimp-my-debian --command 'perl myscript'

If the output of such a command is something like:

  Can't locate Foo/Bar.pm in @INC...

or:

  Base class package "Foo::Bar" is empty...

Then this script is what you need.
It will try to autodetect dependencies and annoy the debian
packaging system to death until:

1) your command succeeds

or:

2) there's no available dependency to be installed

Lots of cool ideas could be added to this little beast.
